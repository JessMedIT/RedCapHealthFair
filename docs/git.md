# Git

Git is a version control system. There are plenty of resources on the web that
give an overview of what Git is and how to use it. This document will briefly
explain why it is used in this project. See
[this](https://git-scm.com/video/what-is-version-control) video for an
introduction on the importance and use of git.

Briefly, git allows us to maintain **who** made changes to **what** portions
of our REDCap data dictionary and **why**. REDCap currently logs who makes
changes, however, it's logs do not tell us what, nor allow the editor to
explain the reason for the changes. Until REDCap enables features that allows
this tracking, git is an appropriate alternative.
