# Forking a Repository

*Note:* For a complete understanding and walk through of Forking a repository
[check out this tutorial](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo).

## Overview

- Forking
- Cloning

## Forking

A Fork of a repository is called a "Fork", because you essentially are copying
the entire data structure (all the files, folders, etc) of the repository. And
because all of this has a comprehensively tracked history, you're essentially
creating a *Fork* in the road of the history of the data which, after
modification, can be merged back together into a complete history.

The reason we do this is so that everyone who is working to make changes to
our REDCap instruments can do so in an isolated way that won't affect whatever
someone else is working on. Later, everyone's changes can be merged together.

By clicking the fork button an identical copy of the repository will be
created under your GitHub account, giving you full access to make changes.
This way, the main copy can be completely isolated from changes, and merging
changes will only occur after approved review of the changes.

## Cloning

While forking is a copy of someone else's repository, thus creating two
potentially different histories as different people work on the files
simultaneously, a clone is a copy of your own work which will have identical
histories (because only **you** will be working on these copied files). Why do
you need to copy something again if we just forked it? Because the data
currently exists online, and you need to download it (aka *clone it*) onto
your personal computer in order to actually work with the data.

To clone your repository, open your GitHub desktop application, click File \>
Clone Repository. After that, you will have a copy of the data on your
computer ready to work with the data after setting up.
