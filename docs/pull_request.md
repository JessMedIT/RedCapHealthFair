# Pull request

*See detailed information from GitHub.com here on [pull
requests](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)*

A pull request allows you to *pull* changes from one repository to another.
This is an important step because it allows you to **review** the changes
before merging them with your data so that you can reject and/or accept what
you need.
